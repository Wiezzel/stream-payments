This pallet supports creating *streams* i.e. ongoing payments. Once a stream is opened,
on every block a specified amount of funds will be transferred from the origin account
to the given target account, until the stream is closed.

## Interface

### Config

* `MaxStreams: u32` â€“ The maximum number of streams per account.

### Dispatchable functions

* `open_stream(origin, target, spend_rate)`  
   Open a new stream. From the next block on, on each block `spend_rate` will be transferred to the 
  `target` account. The stream can be closed by calling `close_stream`.
* `close_stream(origin, index)`  
   Close a stream. From the next block on, transfers will stop.

## Planned features

- [ ] Add an optional total spend limit for stream and reserve funds for limited streams.
- [ ] Use fixed stream identifiers instead of indices.
- [ ] Introduce fees/deposits for opening streams.
